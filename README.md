 - `listGroupUsers.sh` - convenience script to see all users in a Grouping
 - `cleanupPlotHistory.sh` - if R plot histories are starting to take up too much space
 - `copyToGroupUsers.sh` - copy a file or folder to all users in a group (e.g. to "install" a new R package for everyone)

The remaining scripts are mostly deprecated with the use of GitHub for distribution of assignments and student projects.
